## Getting Started

First, run the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Second the frontend server (open a new terminal without killing the first one):
```bash
npm cd .\frontend\

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```


Open the link in the terminal with your browser to see the result.
